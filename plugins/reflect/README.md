# reflect

Periodic reflection — captures lessons learned as behavioral rules in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

At natural stopping points (task completion, commits, context switches), reflect pauses to identify what went well, what didn't, and what to do differently. Lessons are written as concise, actionable rules directly into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so they're loaded at the start of every future session.
